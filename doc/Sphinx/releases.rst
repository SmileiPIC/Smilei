  * Current filtering with adjustable number of passes per dimension
  * Improved axial boundary conditions for ``AMcylindrical`` geometry

  * Possibility to read external generated by an :doc:`external tool <tables>` (more efficient and stable)

* New ``RadiationSpectrum`` diagnostics available (see :doc:`the doc <radiation_loss>`)
* ``AMcylindrical``: sorting, documentation, subgrid in DiagFields,
  species-related currents and density in probes (not per mode anymore)
* LaserOffset is not recomputed after restart

* Laser Envelope: added envelope equation solver with reduced numerical dispersion
* Bugfixes:

  * Weight-initialization bug in AM geometry when a species was initialized
    on top of a regularly-initialized species
  * LaserOffset was off sideways and temporally by a couple of cells
  * Do not project twice a frozen species
  * Probes for species faulty when 4th order of interpolation
  * Checkpoints ``restart_number=0`` was not used
  * Checkpointing with ``dump_minutes`` could be out of sync between MPI process
  * Prevent deadlock when restart files are corrupted
  * Checkpoints ``file_grouping`` had typo with python3
  * Scalar ``Ukin`` for ions was incorrect, thus ``Ubal`` was also wrong
  * happi had incorrect unit conversion with a sum of two fields
  * fix error occurring when envelope Probes on axis are used in AM geometry

Release 4.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Download**: `Smilei v4.1 <_downloads/smilei-v4.1.tar.gz>`_

* Probe diagnostics of currents and density per species
* Field diagnostics with more than 2^32 points
* Bugfixes:

  * collisions (badly affected by vectorization)
  * adaptive vectorization with dynamic load balancing
  * memory leak in the laser envelope model

* Disable usage of `-ipo` to compile on supercomputers
  despite of saving time simulation

  * it needs too many resources (time and memory) to link
  * it is recommended to do some tests on a new supercomputer
    without and then to re-establish it

.. warning::

  Since version 4.1, the :ref:`definition of macro-particle weights<Weights>`
  has changed to ensure they do not depend on the cell volume. This impacts
  only the users working directly with values of weights. Other simulation
  results should be unchanged.
