Releases
--------

This page lists the major changes, but it is recommended to
get the latest version of Smilei on `GitHub <https://github.com/SmileiPIC/Smilei>`_.

----

Upcoming changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Interface with the PICSAR library (currently experimental)
* Particle merging (beta version)
* Additional prescribed fields that only contribute to pushing particles
* More control over the moving window movement
* More control over the regular position initialization in Cartesian geometries
* AMcylindrical now supports almost all features of the code (Poisson solver and scalar diags still missing)
* Bugfix: particle binning was not following the moving window
* Bugfix: gaussian profile with order 0 was incorrect

Release 4.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Download**: `Smilei v4.2 <_downloads/smilei-v4.2.tar.gz>`_


* Different convention for circular polarization amplitude
* Binomial filter in Cartesian 3D bug fix in parallel implementation
* 1D and 2D laser envelope model
* Cylindrical geometry with azimuthal Fourier decomposition (beta version)
* Compatibility between various ionization and QED models
* Bugfixes:
   * Various crashes linked to vectorization
   * `LaserGaussian2D` when focused far from boundary
   * Laser :py:data:`a0` normalization to :py:data:`omega`
   * Frozen particles are now properly ionized
   * Position initialization over another species with moving window
   * Tracked particles output was missing the mass factor for momenta

----

Release 4.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Download**: `Smilei v4.1 <_downloads/smilei-v4.1.tar.gz>`_

* Probe diagnostics of currents and density per species
* Field diagnostics with more than 2^32 points
* Bugfixes:

 * collisions (badly affected by vectorization)
 * adaptive vectorization with dynamic load balancing
 * memory leak in the laser envelope model
 
* Disable usage of `-ipo` to compile on supercomputers despite of saving time simulation

 * it needs too many resources (time and memory) to link
 * it is recommended to do some tests on a new supercomputer without and then to re-establish it

.. warning::

  Since version 4.1, the :ref:`definition of macro-particle weights<Weights>`
  has changed to ensure they do not depend on the cell volume. This impacts
  only the users working directly with values of weights. Other simulation
  results should be unchanged.
