Parallelization & optimization
==============================

To reach high performances on supercomputers, several techniques have
been developed in Smilei.
While a good understanding of :doc:`parallelization <parallelization>` is mandatory
to run a meaningful PIC simulation for any supercomputer user, other advanced
techniques, such as :doc:`vectorization`, are optional even though they can
provide important advantages.
