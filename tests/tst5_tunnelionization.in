# sim_units: normalisation units for the input data
#            it is used only in the input data & log file
#            codes outputs are always in "normalised" units
#            wavelength = input data are in wavelength-related units
#            normalized = input data are put in code (relativistic) units
#
sim_units = wavelength

# dim: Geometry of the simulation
#      1d3v = cartesian grid with 1d in space + 3d in velocity
#      2d3v = cartesian grid with 2d in space + 3d in velocity
#      3d3v = cartesian grid with 3d in space + 3d in velocity
#      2drz = cylindrical (r,z) grid with 3d3v particles

# necessary to compute additional physics (e.g. ionisation or QED effects)
#
wavelength_SI = 1e-6

# order of interpolation

# SIMULATION TIME 
# either use the resolution (res_time) or time-step (timestep)
#
# res_time  : temporal resolution 
# time step : time step
# sim_time  : duration of the simulation 
#

# SIMULATION BOX : for all space directions (in 2D & 3D use vector of doubles)
# either use the resolution (res_space) or cell-length (cell_length)
#
# res_space   : spatial resolution 
# sim_length  : length of the simulation 
# cell_length : cell-length 
#

# ELECTROMAGNETIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
# bc_em_type_long/trans : boundary conditions used for EM fields 
#                         in the longitudinal or transverse directions
#                         periodic      = periodic BC (using MPI topology)
